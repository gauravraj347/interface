
1. An interface in Java is an abstract type that contains a collection of methods and constant variables. It is used to declare a behavior that classes must implement. They are similar to protocols. Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword, and may only contain method signature and constant declarations (variable declarations that are declared to be both static and final).³
2. As of Java 7, you can have only public and abstract modifiers for the methods of an interface. The public modifier is optional, as all interface methods are implicitly public. The abstract modifier is also optional, as all interface methods are implicitly abstract. For example:

```java
interface MyInterface {
  // These two methods are equivalent
  public abstract void display();
  void display();
}
```

Since Java 8, you can also have default and static methods in an interface, which can have a method body. Default methods are used to provide a default implementation for a method that can be overridden by the implementing class. Static methods are used to provide a utility method that is related to the interface but does not depend on an instance of the interface. For example:

```java
interface MyInterface {
  // A default method with a body
  default void show() {
    System.out.println("This is a default method");
  }

  // A static method with a body
  static void print() {
    System.out.println("This is a static method");
  }
}
```

Since Java 9, you can also have private methods in an interface, which can have a method body. Private methods are used to provide a common functionality for the other methods of the interface, but are not accessible from outside the interface. For example:

```java
interface MyInterface {
  // A private method with a body
  private void log(String message) {
    System.out.println("Logging: " + message);
  }

  // A default method that uses the private method
  default void display(String message) {
    log(message);
    System.out.println("Displaying: " + message);
  }
}
```

3. The use of interface in Java is to achieve abstraction, multiple inheritance, and loose coupling. Abstraction means hiding the implementation details and only showing the functionality to the users. Multiple inheritance means a class can implement more than one interface and inherit the behavior from all of them. Loose coupling means reducing the dependency between the classes by using interfaces as the contract between them. For example:

```java
// An interface that defines the behavior of a drawable object
interface Drawable {
  void draw();
}

// A class that implements the Drawable interface
class Circle implements Drawable {
  // The implementation of the draw method
  public void draw() {
    System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
  }
}

// Another class that implements the Drawable interface
class Rectangle implements Drawable {
  // The implementation of the draw method
  public void draw() {
    System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
  }
}

// A class that uses the Drawable interface as a parameter
class Canvas {
  // A method that accepts any object that implements the Drawable interface
  public void paint(Drawable drawable) {
    // Calling the draw method of the object
    drawable.draw();
  }
}

// A test class that creates different objects and passes them to the Canvas class
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Creating a Circle object
    Circle circle = new Circle();
    // Creating a Rectangle object
    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();
    // Creating a Canvas object
    Canvas canvas = new Canvas();
    // Passing the Circle object to the paint method
    canvas.paint(circle); // Output: Drawing a circle
    // Passing the Rectangle object to the paint method
    canvas.paint(rectangle); // Output: Drawing a rectangle
  }
}
```

4. The difference between abstract class and interface in Java is that an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods, while an interface is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement. Some of the key differences are:

    - An abstract class can have instance methods that implement a default behavior, while an interface can only have abstract methods (except for default and static methods since Java 8, and private methods since Java 9).
    - An abstract class can have member variables, while an interface can only have constant variables (declared as public, static, and final by default).
    - An abstract class can have access modifiers such as public, protected, and private for its methods and properties, while an interface can only have public access (by default).
    - A class can inherit from only one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces. This is because an abstract class represents a type of object, while an interface represents a set of behaviors.
    - An abstract class can extend another class and implement multiple interfaces, while an interface can only extend another interface.
    - An abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword, while an interface is declared using the interface keyword. For example:

```java
// An abstract class that defines the behavior of an animal
abstract class Animal {
  // A non-abstract method that prints the sound of the animal
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
  }

  // An abstract method that returns the number of legs of the animal
  public abstract int getLegs();
}

// A class that extends the abstract class and implements its abstract method
class Dog extends Animal {
  // The implementation of the getLegs method
  public int getLegs() {
    return 4;
  }
}

// An interface that defines the behavior of a pet
interface Pet {
  // An abstract method that returns the name of the pet
  String getName();
}

// A class that extends the abstract class and implements the interface
class Cat extends Animal implements Pet {
  // A private variable to store the name of the cat
  private String name;

  // A constructor that takes the name as a parameter
  public Cat(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // The implementation of the getLegs method
  public int getLegs() {
    return 4;
  }

  // The implementation of the getName method
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
}
```
